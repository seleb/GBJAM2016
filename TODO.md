TODO:

- 1-turn buffs (copy stats to temp obj at start of turn, buffs increase temp, stat checks reference temp instead of original)
- game over screen with reset option
- do stuff when win condition is met (e.g. spawn more enemies, show a win screen)
- balance combat (character stats, abilities)
- come up with name + update title graphic
- implement scalemode option (fit, 1x, 2x, 3x, etc, maybe fullscreen)
- rename punchy?
